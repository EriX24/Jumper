# Jumper

The controls are:
 - W: Player1 jump
 - SPACEBAR: Player2 jump
 - R: Start running and to respawn

Bugs:
 - There really isn't a bug I can find

Info:
 - I added alot of notes in the code
 - There are no TODOs in main.py

Thing to mention:
 - It says "YongbinFan Debugged main.py" but it's a error to do with my stuff...just ignore it please!
 - This is just for fun! :D
 - This took a while to make!
 - I used pygame(not pygame zero) to make this!
 - Next I'm making a Bitcoin like thing!!!

Credits:
 - All credit go to...Clean code on Youtube! I was learning Pygame and learned from him!

I want to say "C u later!!! (See you later!!!)" but I'm taking a long time to upload, so sorry.
